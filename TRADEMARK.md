# OpenDroneMap Trademark Guidelines

OpenDroneMap is an open source organization. Because we make our code available to download and modify, proper use of our trademarks is essential to inform users whether or not OpenDroneMap stands behind a product or service. When using OpenDroneMap trademarks (including some product names that are part of our organization) you must comply with these OpenDroneMap Trademark Guidelines.

Some of our trademark names include:

 * OpenDroneMap
 * WebODM
 * NodeODM
 * ClusterODM

Some of our trademark logos include:

 * ![ODM](https://opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/odm-logo-64x64.png)
 * ![WebODM](https://opendronemap.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/webodm-icon-64x64.png)

However, that is not a complete list of our names, logos, and brand features, all of which are subject to these guidelines.

## When do I need specific permission to use an OpenDroneMap trademark?

You may do the following without receiving specific permission from OpenDroneMap (or its affiliates):

 * Use OpenDroneMap wordmarks in text to truthfully refer to and/or link to unmodified OpenDroneMap programs, products, services and technologies.
 * Use OpenDroneMap logos in visuals to truthfully refer to and/or to link to the applicable programs, products, services and technologies hosted on OpenDroneMap servers.
 * Use OpenDroneMap wordmarks to explain that your software is based on OpenDroneMap's open source code, or is compatible with OpenDroneMap's software.
 * Describe a social media account, page, or community in accordance with the [Social Media Guidelines](#social-media-guidelines).

All other uses of an OpenDroneMap trademark require our prior written permission. This includes any use of a OpenDroneMap trademark in a domain name. Contact us at https://uav4geo.com/contact for more information.

## When allowed, how should I use an OpenDroneMap trademark?

### General Guidelines

#### Do:

 * Use the OpenDroneMap trademark exactly as shown in the list above.
 * Use OpenDroneMap wordmarks only as an adjective, never as a noun or verb. Do not use them in plural or possessive forms. Instead, use the generic term for the OpenDroneMap product or service following the trademark, for example: OpenDroneMap processing software.

#### Don't:

 * Don't use OpenDroneMap trademarks in the name of your business, product, service, app, domain name, publication, or other offering.
 * Don't use marks, logos, company names, slogans, domain names, or designs that are confusingly similar to OpenDroneMap trademarks.
 * Don't use OpenDroneMap trademarks in a way that incorrectly implies affiliation with, or sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by OpenDroneMap of your products or services.
 * Don't display OpenDroneMap trademarks more prominently than your product, service, or company name.
 * Don't use OpenDroneMap trademarks on merchandise for sale (e.g., selling t-shirts, mugs, etc.)
 * Don't use OpenDroneMap trademarks for any other form of commercial use (e.g. offering technical support services), unless such use is limited to a truthful and descriptive reference (e.g. Independent technical support for OpenDroneMap's software).
 * Don't modify OpenDroneMap's trademarks, abbreviate them, or combine them with any other symbols, words, or images, or incorporate them into a tagline or slogan.

 ### Social Media Guidelines

In addition to the General Guidelines above, the name and handle of your social media account and any and all pages cannot begin with an OpenDroneMap trademark. In addition, OpenDroneMap logos cannot be used in a way that might suggest affiliation with OpenDroneMap, including, but not limited to, the account, profile, or header images. The only exception to these requirements is if you've received prior permission from OpenDroneMap.

For example, you cannot name your account, page, or community "OpenDroneMap Representatives" or "OpenDroneMap Software". However, it would be acceptable to name your account, page, or community "Fans of OpenDroneMap" or "Information about OpenDroneMap Software" as long as you do not use the OpenDroneMap trademarks or OpenDroneMap logos or otherwise suggest any affiliation with OpenDroneMap.

### Open Source Project Guidelines

The specific license for each of OpenDroneMap's software products and code says what you can and cannot do with the code itself but does not give permission to use OpenDroneMap's trademarks. If you choose to build on or modify OpenDroneMap's open source code for your own project,

#### You Must:

 * Follow the terms of the Open Source License(s) for OpenDroneMap software products and code.
 * Choose branding, logos, and trademarks that denotes your own unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by OpenDroneMap.
 * Follow the General Guidelines, above.

#### You Must NOT:

* Use any OpenDroneMap trademark in connection with the user-facing name or branding of your project.
 * Use any OpenDroneMap trademark or any part of any OpenDroneMap trademark to incorrectly suggest or give the impression your software is actually published by, affiliated with, or endorsed by OpenDroneMap.

For example, please do not name your project, [Something]-ODM, or OpenDroneMap-[Something]

#### You May:

 * State in words (not using logos or images) that your product "works with" or "is compatible" with certain OpenDroneMap software products, if that is true.
 * State in words (not using logos or images) that your project is based on OpenDroneMap open source technology, if that is true, as long as you also include a statement that your project is not officially associated with OpenDroneMap or its products.

For instance, you may state that your project:

"is proudly built from OpenDroneMap's open source software"

as long as you also include the statement equally prominently:

"[Brand Name] and [Product Name] are not officially associated with OpenDroneMap or its products."

### Cloud-based Services

If you offer a cloud-based service that provides remote access to OpenDroneMap software, it is important that you do so in a way that does not confuse users about who is offering the service. You must not use OpenDroneMap trademarks in the name of your product or service.

You may state in words (not using logos or images) that your product or service features or provides access to unaltered OpenDroneMap software, if this is true.

For example:

Acceptable: [Your Product Name] featuring OpenDroneMap's processing software

Incorrect: OpenDroneMap [Your Product Name]

### OpenDroneMap Community Guidelines

Various permissions to use OpenDroneMap Trademarks have been provided to various members of the OpenDroneMap Community, and these OpenDroneMap Trademark Guidelines do not alter any such previously granted permissions.
