# Governance

OpenDroneMap is an informal organization bringing together individuals and companies toward the goal of creating the most sustainable drone mapping software with the friendliest community on earth.

## How Decisions Are Made

The project makes its decisions following an informal, simple "market-driven" process. It allows the project to move fast and change its course organically, following community interest and technology improvements.

1. Every contribution that is deemed useful to more than 1 person is considered worthy of inclusion into the project.
2. Every suggested feature ("feature request") by the community is implemented when either: a) Someone submits a pull request to implement it b) Someone pays for a contributor to implement it c) A contributor, out of free will, at their own pace, decides to implement it.
3. In the rare cases when the interest of the community might be harmed by a contribution, the "[benevolent dictator](https://github.com/smathermather/)" and the person who made the first commit in the project's git history have a final say on whether a feature is accepted in the codebase or not. In case of disagreement, the person who made the first commit in the project's git history prevails.

## Maintainers

Achieving maintainer status on an OpenDroneMap project is achieved by contributing at least 3 "large" new features. 
The definition of "large" is left up to interpretation, but can be loosely explained as "a feature that brings a significant improvement, change or entirely new module into the codebase". 
For example, fixing a spelling mistake will not be considered a "large" contribution, but building an entire new module or adding localization support will.

To safeguard hijacking of the project from possible bad actors, the "[benevolent dictator](https://github.com/smathermather/)" and the person who made the first commit in the project's git history a final say on whether a contributor can become a maintainer and has the power to revoke maintainer status. In case of disagreement, the person who made the first commit in the project's git history prevails.

## Contributors

Submitting a valid patch, large or small, gives anyone the status of contributor.
